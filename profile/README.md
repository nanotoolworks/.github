Nanotoolworks curates, develops and maintains open-source repositories that pertain to the development of skills to accomplish realtime imaging, machine vision and measurement of properties at the nanoscale level. The ultimate objective is more precise automated control of process variables; the immediate objective is more informed process development intelligence or the ability to furnish a *picture* of what is happening in realtime as atoms are being deposited or etched.
