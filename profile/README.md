Nanotoolworks curates, develops and maintains open-source repositories that pertain to the development of skills to accomplish realtime imaging, machine vision and measurement of properties at the nanoscale level. The ultimate objective is more precise automated control of process variables; the immediate objective is more informed process development intelligence or the ability to furnish a *picture* of what is happening in realtime as atoms are being deposited or etched.

### Human Machine-Augmented Learning Process in List Curation 

What we do is pretty simple ... but a bit tedious. There's no other good way to do it.

We start with a general idea for a list ... and the ideas for lists get better over time and we will of course refine the scope of the list, but at first -- it's important to just get started. 

Getting started means gathering a few hundred papers in order to get a feel for the lay of the land ... reading entries in Wikipedia does not constitute getting started ... that can be part of what is necessary to actually understand what one is reading; it's not a substitute for a LOT of reading. Speedreading abstracts and then reading a couple hundred papers is rather labor intensive ... maybe somewhat discouraging at first, because learning jargon in a technical niche can be pretty tedious, or deliberate humbling affair. Reading is necessarily humbling and frustrating, ie if you understand what you're reading, you are probably doing it wrong OR reading well within your comfort level. It is necessary to be humbled and confused at first --- one must read BROADLY and jump ahead to infer more than what one knows

As an example, we might start with [a paper on TEM video analysis system for microstructural features](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/8f317050a7ccf7147d915cf042834f4fd9a13713/A-Deep-Learning-Based-Automatic-Defect-Analysis-Framework-for-In%20situ-TEM-Ion-Irradiations/graph) and then explore connections to five  or six levels ... starting with the next level of connection, including papers such as one on [the application of deep learning to assist the development of automated microscopy data analysis](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/3f0ec7754db49a04b5c8b4eb6dd390a2b44f4bb2/Multi-defect-detection-and-analysis-of-electron-microscopy-images-with-deep-learning/graph) ... these papers are *probably* perfectly fine papers, except that we start by reading them critically, with extreme skepticism, as if they are total frauds or written by imposters.  Understanding the papers requires developing some understanding of some very fundamental background material, eg it's not just how does TEM work, but what shortcomings does TEM have in practice?  The different papers connected to these papers are also assumed to be complete frauds, even though they are perfectly fine -- after exploring for a while, 250 or 500 papers does not really give us a very complete feel for the lay of the land, but certain terms and names of researchers come up over and over, so that we start being able to read a paper in the niche without having to head off to wikipedia or some other basic reference to understand every other word or term that we encounter.
